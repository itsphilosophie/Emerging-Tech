Jim Farley - the CEO of Ford cannot simply announce a new plan on digitalization. In order for his communication of the vision to the Company and the market to be effective, he himself needs to fully understand and believe in it. Therefore, the proper communication of the current situation and outline of the vision, including clear steps that need to be taken in order to achieve digitalization goals are essential. That can take the form of a presentation before the executive board, whereby all of the aspects will be thoroughly presented and explained so that the leadership will be bought-in on the idea, especially considering the intensive competition and need to advance rapidly in order to retain and subsequently increase Ford’s market position. By securing commitment of senior management, those individuals will then “communicate a vision of what needs to be achieved, and why, in order to demonstrate that digital is an unquestionable priority, make other leaders accountable, and make it harder to back-track.”(Catlin et al., 2017) The goal of securing CEO’s and management support is to make them activists who will take a proactive role in a digital transformation.</b>

What does the company want to achieve? When does the company want to achieve this? These are some questions that Ford has to think about when they are setting their targets. There are many possible features taken in mind for Ford and its FordPass Connect app. It could be the case that not all features turn out to be relevant or that some of them become obsolete. Therefore, Ford should make use of the lean startup method. This method is about building, measuring and learning, also called ‘learning-by-doing’ (Leatherbee &amp; Katila, 2020). Ford should first build up hypotheses. Then they should release their products and do an experiment about which features are useful and which features are unnecessary or becoming obsolete. After gathering and analyzing this data, Ford could make improvements to the products and services it offers, and build up new hypotheses. By making use of the lean startup method over and over again, Ford can keep improving their cars and the FordPass app to the needs of their consumers and remove unnecessary and/or obsolete features, so that they will reach their target of an affordable connected car in the near future.</b>

Ford should not only invest in new business, but also in their current business, so they need to allocate the investment between these two. To be able to do investments, Ford needs people who are willing to invest in this project. What Ford could do for example is give pitches to try to convince people to invest in the project, or try to convince stakeholders to invest in the project. After having enough resources, Ford will be ready to invest in the project. Ford will need around $200 million to be able to invest, so that in 2023, when Ford will start cooperating with Google, the FordPass app can be improved and extended.</b>

One of the most important aspects of a successful lighthouse project is time. Ford Company should move fast with the implementation of the app, rather than chase the perfect solution, because rapid delivery of the project is key to avoid roadblocks and keep your momentum going among the team. FordPass app development should become the company's lighthouse project, because it has high business value and visibility, and will be a crucial element of Ford’s digitalization strategy. The main goal of the project should be to deliver the software upgrade quickly, so that the management is able to observe the rapid release of business value in the app. The aforementioned digitalization vision fits perfectly into the lighthouse project framework, because it has a specific problem to address - enhancing digitalization of Ford Company by developing its main app. FordPass is designed to have a structural impact and will allow new ways of work. Finally, its advancement process should deliver value quickly and often so that it brings a learning environment for both management and teams.&nbsp;</b>

                <p class="u-align-center u-custom-item u-text u-text-default u-text-17"><b>According to Alexey Semeney, founder at DevTeam.Space, a vetted community of expert development teams, forming an app developers’ team requires the hiring of a mobile developer and a backend developer full time, as well as a dev ops specialist, a designer and a QA Specialist part time. “And that’s the bare minimum” says he, “if you want to move fast and build for both Android and iOS, you would need to add at least one more person. If you want to move even faster again then you should add two more people (plus one more for each mobile platform), which means a total of nine people”, as well as the tech project manager who can lead the operational team. He also points out that great developers account for only 20% of mobile apps success and 80% is down to good product management which is why appointing a team and a manager of product/account management is necessary.Considering that Ford already has a team of developers and a team of product management working together on the current FordPass, the launch team of the digital part of our vision is more likely already existing within Ford’s organization. Depending on the propensity of work for this team to achieve, appointing a few more developers and specialists is to be considered.&nbsp;Furthermore, since Ford aims to grant access to its consumers’ favorite streaming app to listen to music via Spotify, Deezer or Youtube for example, it will have to hire some experts in that field in order to implement this feature within FordPass. Luckily, Ford partnership with Google will help since these apps are downloaded directly from Google Play Store for Android users. Google’s and Ford team working together tightly should be able to launch this feature in the short term for Android users. Therefore, the cost of the project shouldn’t be much. In order to make sure the feature will also be accessed by iOS users, it is recommended that Ford hire a team specialized in iOS including at least an iOS app developer, an iOS mobile developer, an iOS software developer and an iOS software engineer to integrate its organization. On average, the whole cost of the iOS specialized team should be 400 thousands dollars in the US. Furthermore, among all these teams, one person should be appointed as a spokesperson to keep Ford’s highest chain of command and its stakeholders updated on the progress of both the developers team and the product/account management team. The spokesperson can also be the person currently responsible for the FordPass app, whose task will be to keep track of the whole project’s progress.</b>

                <p class="u-align-center u-custom-item u-text u-text-default u-text-20"><b>The current team of Ford’s developers will have to work to bring our vision to life. As explained above, appointing a few more developers to do so is considered and will depend on the propensity of work to achieve. Furthermore, since Ford has decided to partner-up with Google for the launching of cars beginning 2023 and as explained in our vision, Ford should start adapting its app to its future connected car and allow its consumers access to their favorite music streaming apps for example. Therefore, Engineers and developers from both Ford and Google as well as the iOS developers team will have to work together, brainstorm and align their strategies and knowledge to create a hybrid mobile app, ideally following the lean startup method.Once the new app is launched, the firm will need to introduce several of its employees to new ways of working. Indeed, the team of sellers located in Ford local stores will need to redefine their occupations by adding some tasks to their routine: they will need to check and manage appointments for test drives made by clients, implement them in their schedules, engage in a follow-up with clients to potentially close a deal, and perform a cleaning service after each test-drives as covid barriers, as well as cleaning deeply each car on a regular basis to offer the best experience to potential new Ford clients.&nbsp; As explained above, depending on the importance of the flow of appointments, and clients' visits to the stores, the hiring of 1-2 more sellers should be considered. Ford could even create a Key Performance Indicator and set goals to its employees to achieve, which could lead to bonuses.The same sort of change will be operated on Ford mechanicians. They will have to check and manage appointments, work their schedules, and engage a follow-up with clients to offer the best service possible. This follow-up will include things like checking when will take place the next car inspection, quickly check tires pressure and the level of oil for non-electric vehicles, etc, in order to let the client go with an optimized car and not saturate the appointments’ list. Therefore mecaniciens' jobs will be much more digitized than they used to be. Both sellers and mecaniciens shouldn’t worry much about this new organization of their work because their expertise is still much required, as a result of Bottleneck’s theory. Indeed, according to him, the propensity of a job to be computerized is more likely to be extremely low or non-existent if the job requires creativity, perception, and physical manipulation or social intelligence, which is the case of sellers and mecanics here.</b>

This includes a focus shift away from traditional, slow, and cumbersome procedures and rigid structures towards a more agile and responsive approach that takes customer feedback into account while perpetually monitoring the digital landscape for interesting and relevant changes that could influence customer demands. A shift in a company’s culture on this scale cannot occur overnight, but it is an important part for the future of the company, seeing as the platform model is reliant on constant updates and incorporation of feedback for new features in order to prevent stagnation and keep competitors from outpacing Ford.The company culture should strive towards a unified view of the Brand, the platform, and the actual products in order to create the best possible customer experience, encouraging new and fresh ideas in flat hierarchies instead of relying on outdated corporate structures. This should facilitate further changes in the uncertain future of the digital playing field by making the company’s efforts maneuverable and responsive by focusing on the value proposition for the customer. With the inevitable rise and fall of complementary and competing platforms, keeping an eye on developments and changes in customer demands should be prioritized in order to stay relevant and at the forefront of digital developments. The digital culture should also serve to encourage employees to come up with fresh ideas and bring them forward, nurturing an attitude of design thinking among the employees and making use of the massive scale and diversity of the company.</b>

                <p class="u-align-center u-custom-item u-text u-text-default u-text-26"><b>Since the platform is neither based on a subscription model nor will it contain advertisements, the main returns need to be generated by vehicle sales and other transactions which occur through the application. From a fiscal standpoint, it would therefore make sense to focus the early stages of development on the features most likely to attract more users as well as facilitate vehicle sales and other services that create value for the company. Getting Ford’s current customer base acquainted with the platform will help make the platform more attractive to outside actors as well, so the transition should be made transparent, and users should be informed about the benefits of the new system. However, it should be noted that the implementation of the platform is not primarily a short-term measure to generate income, but rather a long-term plan to shift the focus of the entire company in order to stay relevant for a long time to come and some growing pains will be inevitable. The future of the automobile industry is still uncertain, but the platform should afford Ford the maneuverability and potential to keep up with the competition and stay profitable.Despite this, the concept is going to need to prove itself in practice if it is to become the future of the company and measurably increased returns make for a convincing argument in most circumstances, so prioritizing short-term income in the beginning of the project is a sensible choice. This, however, should not come at the expense of the vision for the company’s future, making resource allocation and the setting of realistic expectations an important part of the platform proposal. Since it is impossible to pinpoint which features of the platform are responsible for which part of the generated income, customer feedback is important in order to grasp which platform developments should be pursued immediately and which ones are less integral to the value proposition. With an agile development approach and constant feedback, focusing initial efforts on quick returns is a feasible goal, although it should not overshadow the greater picture for the sake of potentially unreasonable expectations towards profit margins.</b>

As the work begins, a key part of building capabilities is to pay critical attention to the systems and innovations that work best, experiment on processes to make sure that we not only focus on the potential product but also on the best possible workflow to allow for the product to succeed. Metrics and measurement focusing on the input, output and behavior are essential to make sure that each of the resulting processes that will be used as standard are in fact the best (Ideascale, 2016).</b>

This new organizational design should be able to connect all the new structures of the digital transformation to the already well established ones in order to share data, expertise and talent. (McKinsey, 2017)Ford currently works in a matrix structure and it should move onto a network structure that allows for product management without the limitations of a certain team and allow for teams to be flexible and project based which provides a new way utilizing talent and regroup ro resource around new projects or income opportunities. This new way of working is mainly based on agile principles. Which provide a full new scalable way of adopting innovation within the company.</b>
