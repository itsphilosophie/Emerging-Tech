While Ford does offer a company app, it is an underutilized tool that has the potential to play a part in a much more involved customer experience through a different approach, namely the shift from a simple application to a customizable and scalable platform. The main purpose of the platform is to allow Ford to compete with other manufacturers that have been paving the way for digital innovation in the automotive industry, but this cannot be achieved without an accompanying change in the vehicle line-up in both sales and production. Through the integration of digital features and a wider range of affordable electric vehicles, the value of the platform can be maximized while capitalizing on a market that is currently less relevant to electric car manufacturers due to the often-higher price categories of electric vehicles when compared to their combustion-engine counterparts. Additionally, the used vehicle market for electric vehicles is currently much less prolific as a result of the subpar performance of many of the early generations of electric cars.</b>

For prospective customers, the application can be used to find a local car dealer and schedule an appointment for a test drive or to look at a particular vehicle in person. Subsequently, the salesman can send important data on the models as well as their specific desired features to the customer using the application and the customer can customize and make a final decision from the comfort of their home, at their own pace. The application allows the user to select and order any vehicle online, giving them the option of having the car delivered to their home or picking it up at a dealership of their choice when it is ready. The app makes this process simple, intuitive, and transparent and gives the customer an experience and vehicle tailored to their specific demands. Buying a vehicle, however, is only a small part of the functionality of the platform. It can be used to track the vehicle, to collect and show relevant information and data about the car, while integrating a wide range of digital functionalities. Some of these functionalities are currently integrated into the Ford app already, but we have decided to include them for the sake of completeness of our vision.</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>Since Ford has a global presence and is much more widely known than some of its competitors, uniting its operations in a single platform holds massive potential for many of the involved players: Salespeople and workshops profit from a simple system aiding in clear communication with the customer, prospective customers are presented with a streamlined and clear process for browsing and buying vehicles, and car owners are presented with a heap of additional features, services, and customization options that simplify many of the more annoying inevitabilities of car ownership while allowing for integration of additional and potentially yet undiscovered applications through the built-in API. In order to make use of the application, however, additional electric and potentially self-driving models are required, since the current Ford line-up only includes two true electric vehicles, the Mustang as well as the Raptor, neither of which are particularly suited for lower-income markets or people just looking for an everyday vehicle. It is not necessary to shift the brand’s entire focus towards those markets, but it seems much more challenging to compete with established luxury brands such as Tesla, which have already attracted much global attention and have established themselves as cutting-edge innovators by focusing on not just selling a product, but a full experience including a number of additional services and offers. Even so, the full experience is usually a costly one and offering a similar service attached to a more affordable vehicle could allow Ford to proliferate themselves as the affordable automotive brand for the future. Four to five additional electric models built to cover a range of different purposes and target demographics in conjunction with the proposed platform would form a solid basis for a more modern, innovative, and future-proof Ford, all of which are of vital importance in the current landscape of the automobile industry.</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"><b>According to the architectural theory of digital innovation, a layered modular architecture is required to make it possible to enhance physical products with digital capabilities. A layered modular architecture is described as a “hybrid of the modular architecture of a physical product and the layered architecture of digital technology” (Yoo et al., 2010). This architecture hybridizes hierarchically arranged components of physical products with modules of digital functionality configured into layers (Hylving &amp; Schultze, 2020). The layered architectural model consists of 4 layers. From the bottom to the top, there is the Devices layer, the Network layer, the Service layer and the Contents layer.</b>

It involves two parts: the physical machinery, or in other words the hardware that users work with, and the logical capabilities of that physical object, meaning the operating system on the hardware (Yoo et al., 2010). According to Makhtar Diop (2020), the Managing Director&nbsp; and Executive Vice President of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for connectivity in many domains (1). From commerce to social gatherings to the latest entertainment (2), consumers are nowadays looking for services that can be accessed everywhere and anytime. For that reason, the FordPass app is a Saas that can be downloaded on smartphones. Nevertheless, FordPass offers this connectivity directly within Ford’s core products with the digital screen, nowadays present within each car. And, according to Ford Media Center, Ford has partnered-up with Google for six years, and beginning in 2023, millions of future Ford vehicles at all price points will be powered by Android with Google apps and services built-in. Indeed, it is Ford’s future strategy/goal to create the ultimate affordable connected car. The FordPass app could then offer an additional degree of connectivity since the connected car would become a device itself, with the FordPass software built-in.</b>

                <p class="u-custom-item u-text u-text-6"><b>The Network layer of the layered modular architecture model is about the transmission of data. The transmission of data is the transfer of data from one digital device to another digital device. The Network layer can be divided into two parts: a physical transport layer, for example cables, and a logical transmission layer, for example TCP/IP (Yoo et al., 2010). In a car, a smartphone can be connected to the digital screen of the car via Bluetooth, to play music for example. Next to that, in recent years, many cars have made it possible to make use of Wi-Fi while driving in the car. Mostly newer cars today come standard with Wi-Fi hotspots. An example of this Wi-Fi connection is the FordPass. This FordPass app is an app for smartphones that links up to SYNC Connect and makes it possible for drivers to remotely locate their vehicle, check the fuel level, start the engine and configure climate controls (Hearst Autos Research, 2021). For the first five years, making use of the FordPass app is free. The FordPass Connect app on a smartphone can be connected to Ford cars that have been produced from 2018 onwards, like the Ford Mustang 2019 model and the Ford Escape 2019 model. However, Ford cars from the years 2010-2017 could also make use of the FordPass app, so that these users of the “older” Ford cars could also make use of some, but not all, improvements that can improve their driving experience. But, here’s the rub: For the people who own an older Ford car to make use of the FordPass app, there is a monthly fee associated. This monthly fee is $17, and next to that, installation and data aren’t included. Speaking of data, that service comes by way of Verizon, which also asks a monthly fee (Hyatt, 2018). What Ford will try to achieve by partnering up with Google in 2023, is making it possible for all Ford drivers to make use of the Wi-Fi connection via the FordPass app and thus the ultimate connected car, because now it is way too expensive for many Ford drivers to afford such a car, which can make them decide to buy a car of another car company.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;cupidatat non proident.

                <p class="u-custom-item u-text u-text-8"><b>The Service layer of the layered modular architecture model is the application functionalities that are consumed by users (Yoo et al., 2010). Ford was the first company to offer connected services for no charge. Indeed, the firm introduced the FordPass app, powered by FordPass, in 2016 and offers already several features to its consumers:&nbsp;<br>It allows users access to their cars’ data: tire pressure, level of fuel/battery left with the conversion in kilometers, car’s location, lock/unlock car, as well as start/stop the air conditioning and a built-in Wifi hotspot.&nbsp;<br>It notifies users whenever they need to do their mandatory car inspection, as well as whenever the car has been unlocked (even with the second key).<br>It allows users to plan their journeys with the integrated GPS including live traffic and accident notifications, and the possibility to locate parking lots, gas stations and electric chargers.<br>It puts users in direct relation with the Ford store nearby by enabling the location of nearby Ford stores and scheduling car inspections’ appointments.<br>It grants users a personalized (non-robotized) roadside assistance in case of emergencies.<br>Nevertheless, as explained above, we believe the FordPass app can offer Ford’s consumers access to richer services and grant access to all Ford services from the buying experience to a day-to-day experience. Indeed, in our vision, consumers would be able to buy a car directly from the app, with or without previous test-drive(s) realized in the nearest Ford store. Besides locating the nearest Ford store, consumers could have access to the available test-driving cars in every Ford store and schedule their test-drives directly from the app. In our opinions, the app features needs to be improved as well: a consumer should be able to remotely control its car’s doors, hatches and any other vehicle-specific features. As for the maintenance service, we also recommend adding an integrated breakdown service that directly transmits vehicles data to a licensed technician which could be used by consumers for technical advice as well as for towing and repair services. It could eventually include technical and warranty updates as well as recommendations for the replacement of main essential components of the vehicle. We aim to also improve the driving experience of consumers throughout the use of the FordPass app by adding media features such as music or video playing, integrating popular services like Spotify and Youtube, as a starting point to the digital transformation of Ford’s products and services which will take place on new vehicles coming out beginning 2023.</b>

Most cars nowadays have digital screens, on which they can for example control the radio, music apps, the internet and navigation apps like Google Maps, manage their car settings, or make use of a camera that helps you with parking or films the entire trip you have driven, which can be important when for example an accident happens on the road. What Ford could do to make the overall experience of their connected cars better, is offering unique content on the car screens. Since Ford and Google will partner-up in the future, Google could possibly help Ford with these unique content offerings. Ford-owners could then download the FordPass app and make use of the content that Ford, working together with Google, offers on the car screens.</b>
